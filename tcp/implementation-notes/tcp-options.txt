3.2.  Specific Option Definitions

   A TCP Option, in the mandatory option set, is one of an End of Option
   List Option, a No-Operation Option, or a Maximum Segment Size Option.

   An End of Option List Option is formatted as follows:

       0
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       0       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   Kind:  1 byte; Kind == 0.

     This option code indicates the end of the option list.  This might
     not coincide with the end of the TCP header according to the Data
     Offset field.  This is used at the end of all options, not the end
     of each option, and need only be used if the end of the options
     would not otherwise coincide with the end of the TCP header.

   A No-Operation Option is formatted as follows:

       0
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       1       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   Kind:  1 byte; Kind == 1.

     This option code can be used between options, for example, to align
     the beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.  There is
     no guarantee that senders will use this option, so receivers MUST
     be prepared to process options even if they do not begin on a word
     boundary (MUST-64).

   A Maximum Segment Size Option is formatted as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       2       |     Length    |   Maximum Segment Size (MSS)  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   Kind:  1 byte; Kind == 2.

     If this option is present, then it communicates the maximum receive
     segment size at the TCP endpoint that sends this segment.  This
     value is limited by the IP reassembly limit.  This field may be
     sent in the initial connection request (i.e., in segments with the
     SYN control bit set) and MUST NOT be sent in other segments (MUST-
     65).  If this option is not used, any segment size is allowed.  A
     more complete description of this option is provided in
     Section 3.7.1.

   Length:  1 byte; Length == 4.

     Length of the option in bytes.

   Maximum Segment Size (MSS):  2 bytes.

     The maximum receive segment size at the TCP endpoint that sends
     this segment.

3.2.1.  Other Common Options

   Additional RFCs define some other commonly used options that are
   recommended to implement for high performance but are not necessary
   for basic TCP interoperability.  These are the TCP Selective
   Acknowledgment (SACK) Option [22] [26], TCP Timestamp (TS) Option
   [47], and TCP Window Scale (WS) Option [47].

3.2.2.  Experimental TCP Options

   Experimental TCP Option values are defined in [30], and [45]
   describes the current recommended usage for these experimental
   values.
