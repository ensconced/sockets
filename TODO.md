# TODO

- re-architect to use new queue approach for simplification of multithreading approach
- remove all redundant mutexes

In the new setup, basically all the work will be done by the main thread.
There are other helper threads, but all these do is push items onto the event queue.
There is only a single mutex required - to protect the event queue.
The main thread then...hmm...spinlocks? to wait for things to appear on the event queue? not sure how that should work...
No need for a spinlock - I should be able to use pthread_cond_wait & pthread_cond_signal



- resolve hacks in main.c
  - write handle_user_call
  - tcp_send should dispatch "SEND" action
  - "SEND" action should be handled as per RFC 9293

- buffered sending

- the "SEND" action isn't for sending "a segment"!
- rather, it's for sending "some bytes"!
- so I think all we really need in terms of the send buffer, is...well...a buffer
- what shall we call it? how about the "transmission queue"??
- so...I think my first task is to implement this transmission queue

What does the transmission queue consist of?

Basically just a buffer, with some max length.
I guess this will be attached to the tcp_connection struct?

What associated methods are there?

queue_for_transmission(bytes)
take_data(max_size)

?

- once connection is established, should do take_data, and send that data...
  (until the queue is empty)

should there be a separate thread for sending from the queue? which thread owns the queue?
will it need a mutex? I think not - we'll just use the connection pool mutex.











- get tests passing
- check checksums using wireshark validation
- WHY am I not getting a SYN/ACK back?
- debug - not finding SYN ACK - try wireshark alongside lldb?...
- ...it seems that it's actually iptables that's the problem here??? it's blocking my incoming packets...I thought it wasn't meant to affect raw sockets though??
- maybe try using QUEUE/NFQUEUE as suggested in the comments here https://serverfault.com/questions/387263/disable-kernel-processing-of-tcp-packets-for-raw-socket - you then have to explicitly read from the queue in your code, but that's maybe not so bad? eventually we will move over to using AF_PACKET anyway, which hopefully will actually bypass iptables rules?
- implement process_incoming_segment
- get to the established state
- strerror is not threadsafe - come up with better error handling solution
- switch over to using lower-level packet sockets (https://linux.die.net/man/7/packet) (initially with SOCK_DGRAM, and then eventually even lower-level SOCK_RAW...) - requires implementing ARP myself, I think?
- eventually we'll be able to remove all the config from /etc/network/interfaces, because we'll be implementing it all ourselves (including arp etc)

### TCP

- implement TCP
- provide API for simply creating a single TCP connection, that follows the state machine flow
- success condition is a program that:
  - opens a single passive connection to serve my website
  - can be used to serve a single HTTP request/response
  - then the connection closes...

i.e. I want to be able to use it like this:

```c
int main(void) {
  // initialise the tcp stack. this will initialise some data structures and
  // spawn a couple of helper threads - one for receiving IP packets, and one for
  // handling timeouts.
  // NB if you call tcp_init a second time it should be an error.
  tcp_stack stack = tcp_init();
  // obtain a pointer to a new connection. NB the state of this connection gets
  // updated by another thread behind the scenes. Each connection will have
  // a mutex as a field on the struct.
  connection* conn = tcp_open_passive(&stack);
  // NB most of these methods will first need to obtain the connection
  // mutex, before checking the current state of the connection,
  // taking any actions, changing the state etc., and then releasing
  // the mutex again
  tcp_send(conn, /* */);
  // I guess this needs to be "callback style" - i.e. should take a function
  // pointer to be called with the results, instead of blocking.
  // How would you implement that though? I guess what it does internally
  // is actually just push that function pointer (or a struct containing it)
  // to an array so that it can be called when the data is actually received?
  // So this means your function pointer will actually end up getting called
  // within a different thread...which I guess is fine.
  tcp_receive(conn, /* */, handle_data);
  tcp_status(conn, /* */);
  tcp_close(conn, /* */);
  tcp_abort(conn, /* */);
}
```

### HTTP

- build http server on top of TCP implementation
- basically needs to ensure that at least one TCP connection is always in LISTEN state
- this can be acheived in a simple way?

  - calloc an array of TCBs, of length MAX_CONNECTIONS
  - ???

- should actually parse request and send appropriate response (not just send response immediately on connecting!)

###Â HTTPS

- generate self-signed certificate and implement TLS using that
- install certbot and use that to generate actual CA signed certs instead
